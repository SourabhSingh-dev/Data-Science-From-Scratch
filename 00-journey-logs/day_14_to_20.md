# 🗓️ Day 14–20 – 03/09/2025 → 02/09/2025

### 📍 Status: ✅ Completed (7 Days Work)

---

## ✅ What I did over 7 days:

### 📌 SQL Progress:
- 🛠️ **DML (Data Manipulation Language)**
  - Practiced `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`
  - Learned about committing changes and rollback
- 🔗 **SQL Joins**
  - Inner Join, Left Join, Right Join, Full Join
  - Used joins on practice tables (Students, Courses, Enrollments)
- 🔍 **Subqueries**
  - Practiced nested queries in `WHERE` and `SELECT`
  - Compared correlated vs non-correlated subqueries

---

### 📌 Machine Learning Progress:
- 🎯 **Introduction to ML**
  - Understood what ML is and its types (Supervised, Unsupervised, Reinforcement)
  - Explored difference between AI, ML, and DL
- 📈 **Simple Linear Regression**
  - Learned concept of regression line (`y = mx + c`)
  - Understood slope (m) and intercept (c) interpretation
  - Practiced training a model on small datasets
  - Visualized regression line and error terms

---

## 📘 Resources Used:
- SQL Tutorial series (YT + notes)  
- ML Beginner Course (YT + Coursera snippets)  
- Jupyter Notebook for ML practice  
- Online SQL sandbox  

---

## 🔄 Next Up (Plan):
- 📅 **Saturday** → SQL practice & revision  
- 📅 **Monday** → Mathematics for ML (linear algebra & probability basics)  
- 📅 **Weekdays (Tue–Fri)** → Continue ML topics (Multiple Linear Regression, Evaluation Metrics, etc.)  

---

## 📝 Reflections:
- SQL DML, Joins & Subqueries gave real database feel — not just structure but working with actual data  
- ML intro + regression felt exciting, finally connecting maths + code into something practical  
- Realized the need to **balance SQL fundamentals + ML concepts** without rushing
