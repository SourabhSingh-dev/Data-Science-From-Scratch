# 🗓️ Day 21 – 15/09/2025  

### 📍 Status: ✅ Completed  

---

## ✅ What I did today:  

### 📌 Topics Reviewed & Practiced:  
- 📊 **Linear Regression**  
  - Implemented code for **Simple Linear Regression** from scratch (using Python + NumPy)  
  - Covered ~ **2/3 of the mathematical formulation**.
  - Verified results by plotting regression line vs data points  

---

## 🧩 Practice & Execution:  
- Wrote Python code for:  
  - Hypothesis function `y = mx + c`  
- Tested model on small synthetic dataset  

---

## 📘 Resources Used:  
- 📄 My Linear Regression notes (math + code)  
- 🔗 YT videos on Linear Regression math intuition  
- 🧪 Jupyter Notebook for experiments  

---

## 🔄 Next Up:  
- Complete **remaining mathematical formulation** (normal equation, R² metric)  
- Learn **how to effectively use ChatGPT in Data Science** (debugging, explanations, code optimization, quick references)  

---

## 📝 Reflections:  
- Coding linear regression manually gave deeper understanding of each component  
- Excited to see how ChatGPT can act as a **coding + math assistant** in the workflow
