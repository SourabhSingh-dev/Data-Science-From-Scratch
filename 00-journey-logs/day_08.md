### 📍 Status: ✅ Completed

## Cause of Gap 13/07/2025 to 04/08/2025
   - Was Diagnosed with typhoid and my body took much time to get healed.

## ✅ What I did today:

* 📌 **Topics Revisited:**
  -  **Introduction to numpy**
    - Why numpy is better than lists.
  - 🔁 **Indexing in Arrays**
    - Row/column selection using `[i, j]` and slicing
    - Negative indexing and its use
  - 🧮 **Array Slicing**
    - Extracting submatrices using `:` syntax
    - Slicing specific rows/columns or blocks
  - 🧊 **Modifying Arrays**
    - Changing values at specific indexes
    - Replacing subregions using slicing
  - 🧪 **Masking & Boolean Indexing**
    - Creating masks like `arr > 10`
    - Filtering arrays using masks
  - ➕ **Basic Operations in Arrays**
    - Element-wise arithmetic: `+`, `-`, `*`, `**`
    - Comparison operations
    - Mathematical functions like `np.log()`, `np.sin()`

* 📘 **Resources Used:**  
  - Udemy Course - Python for Data Science.
  - Practiced examples in **Jupyter Notebook** and **VS Code**

* 🧠 Notes & Execution:
  - Detailed notes created for all sections (with outputs and explanations)
  - Hands-on practice done for slicing, masking, and array ops

---

## 🔄 Next Up:
* 🚀 Continue with:
  - **Matrix Product**
  - **More Array Operations (reshape, transpose, sum, etc.)**
* 📘 Create next chunk of detailed notes with explanations and examples

---

## 📝 Reflections:
* Revisiting these weak spots helped solidify the fundamentals  
* Masking and slicing are **extremely powerful** once clearly understood  
* Will continue this structured format for remaining NumPy topics as well
