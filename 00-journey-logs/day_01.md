# 🗓️ Day 01 – 15/06/2025

### 📍 Status: ✅ Completed

---

## ✅ What I did today:

* 📌 **Topic Studied:** Python Functions, Inbuilt Data Structures & Modules

* 📘 **Resources:** Krish Naik’s Data Science Udemy Course (Sections 6, 7, and 8)

* 💻 **Problems Solved:**

  * Q1–Q5: Basic warm-ups (e.g., Celsius to Fahrenheit, Rectangle Area, Line Equation) – solved in Udemy only
  * Q6–Q7, Q10–Q13: Medium problems – solved but not pushed (simple logic)
  * Q8–Q9, Q14–Q20: Significant logic – solved & pushed to GitHub with better versions where applicable

* ✅ **New Folder Added:** `betterways/` inside `00-data-structures/` to store cleaner/optimized versions

* 📁 **GitHub Updates:**

  * Added clean `.py` files with docstrings and `__main__` testing blocks
  * Created a consistent structure for Python foundation practice
  * Logged better approaches in separate `_betterway.py` files

## 🔄 Next Up:

* Begin Section 9: File Handling (with proper notes)
* Resume DSA (GCD, LCM, etc.)
* Begin daily DSA+DS revision cycle

---

## 📝 Notes & Reflections:

* Started using `if __name__ == "__main__"` for modular, testable Python code
* Created a dedicated `betterways/` folder for cleaner code organization
* Practicing discipline by avoiding unnecessary pushes of trivial questions
* Completed Section 8 (Modules, Standard Library usage, Import system) with full clarity
