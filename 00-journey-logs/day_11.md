# 🗓️ Day 11 – 08/08/2025

### 📍 Status: ✅ Completed

---

## ✅ What I did today:

### 📌 Topics Reviewed & Practiced:
- 🧮 **Pandas Boolean Indexing (Masking)**
  - Created masks for filtering values based on conditions
  - Applied masks to entire DataFrames and single columns
  - Used multiple conditions with logical operators (`&`, `|`)
- 🌸 **Iris Dataset Exploration**
  - Loaded CSV data into DataFrame
  - Used `.head()`, `.tail()`, `.shape()`, `.columns`, `.dtypes`, `.info()`
  - Generated statistical summaries with `.describe()`
  - Counted unique values and filtered specific species
  - Applied aggregate functions (`mean`, `max`, `min`, `sum`)
- 📊 **Sorting Data**
  - Used `.sort_values(by=[...])` for multi-column sorting

### 🧩 Practice & Execution:
- Implemented **masking examples** from notes in Jupyter Notebook
- Practiced filtering with both single and multiple conditions
- Explored Iris dataset with different column and row operations
- Verified sorting behavior using ascending multi-column sorting

### 📘 Resources Used:
- YT Videos
- 📄 Pandas PDF notes  
- 🧠 Custom Notion-friendly notes (with explanations + outputs)  
- 🧪 Jupyter Notebook for live practice

## 🔄 Next Up:
- Start with **`iris.apply()` and lambda functions**
- Explore **grouping data with `.groupby()`**
- Begin **aggregations and descriptive stats on groups**

---

## 📝 Reflections:
- Masking is a powerful way to filter DataFrames quickly  
- Learned to avoid chained indexing pitfalls in filtering  
- Sorting by multiple columns is straightforward but useful for real datasets
