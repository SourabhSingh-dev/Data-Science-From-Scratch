# 🗓️ Day 27 – 22/09/2025  

### 📍 Status: ✅ Completed  

---

## ✅ What I did today:  

### 📌 Topics Reviewed & Practiced:  
- 📈 **Polynomial Regression (Introduction)**  
  - Learned the concept of polynomial regression as an extension of linear regression  
  - Understood how higher-degree terms (`x²`, `x³`, …) can model non-linear relationships  
  - Explored how polynomial regression fits curved data patterns better than straight lines  

---

## 🧩 Practice & Execution:  
- Reviewed mathematical formulation of polynomial regression  
- Understood preprocessing steps (feature transformation using polynomial features)  
- Prepared datasets to apply polynomial regression in the next session  

---

## 📘 Resources Used:  
- 📄 Regression notes (Polynomial Regression section)  
- 🔗 Online tutorials + videos on Polynomial Regression intuition  
- 🧪 Jupyter Notebook (setup for upcoming coding practice)  

---

## 🔄 Next Up:  
- Implement **Polynomial Regression in Python** (with and without scikit-learn)  
- Visualize how model performance changes with polynomial degree  
- Compare results against simple linear regression  

---

## 📝 Reflections:  
- Polynomial regression feels like a natural step after linear regression  
- Excited to code it out and see the curve fitting in action tomorrow  
- Key insight: polynomial regression increases flexibility but also risks **overfitting**
