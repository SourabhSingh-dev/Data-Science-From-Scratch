### 📍 Status: ✅ Completed  

---

## ✅ What I did today:  

### 📌 Topics Reviewed & Practiced:  
- 📊 **Multiple Linear Regression**  
  - Implemented code for **Multiple Linear Regression** from scratch (using Python + NumPy)  
  - Covered ~ **2/3 of the mathematical formulation**)  
  - Verified results by plotting predicted values vs actual data points  

---

## 🧩 Practice & Execution:  
- Wrote Python code for:  
  - Hypothesis function `y = Xβ + ε`  
- Tested model on small synthetic dataset with multiple features  

---

## 📘 Resources Used:  
- 📄 My Linear Regression notes (math + code)  
- 🔗 YT videos on Multiple Linear Regression (math intuition)  
- 🧪 Jupyter Notebook for experiments  

---

## 🔄 Next Up:  
- Complete **remaining mathematical formulation** (Normal Equation, R² metric)  
- Learn **how to effectively use ChatGPT in Data Science** (debugging, explanations, code optimization, quick references)  

---

## 📝 Reflections:  
- Implementing **multiple regression** clarified the difference between scalar and vectorized approaches  
- Excited to integrate ChatGPT as a **coding + math assistant** in my DS workflow
