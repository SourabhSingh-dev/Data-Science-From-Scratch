## ✅ What I did today:

* 📌 **Topics Covered:**  
  - Modules and Packages  
  - File Handling (theory + full assignment)  
  - Exception Handling (theory + partial assignment)

* 📘 **Resources:** Krish Naik’s Data Science Udemy Course (Sections 8, 9, and start of 10)

* 💻 **Tasks Completed:**
  - Solved assignment questions on Modules and Packages
  - Implemented and practiced various file operations: reading, writing, appending
  - Learned `with open(...)`, manual file closing, and `finally` block safety patterns
  - Started exception handling assignment: wrote and tested `try-except`, `finally`, `locals()`, and `file.closed` logic

---

## 🔄 Next Up:
* Complete remaining Exception Handling assignment
* Start Section 10: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
* Revise and push clean `.py` files to GitHub

---

## 📝 Notes & Reflections:
* File handling is crystal clear now — especially how and when to close files safely
* Learned how to write cleaner modular Python code using `if __name__ == "__main__"`
* Practiced structured exception patterns and understood the logic behind error-safe final blocks
* Stayed productive despite minor urge spikes — redirected focus into theory + coding
