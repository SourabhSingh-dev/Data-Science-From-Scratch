# 🗓️ Day 10 – 07/08/2025

### 📍 Status: ✅ Completed

---

## ✅ What I did today:

### 📌 Topics Reviewed & Practiced:
- **Completed the Numpy Assignment** 
- 🧵 **Pandas Indexing & Extracting Data**
  - `.loc[]` vs `.iloc[]` access methods
  - Label-based vs position-based indexing
  - Row/column slicing with `.iloc[rows, cols]`
  - Custom index assignment using `df.index = [...]`
- ⚖️ Compared:
  - `df.iloc[1:4, 2:]` ✅ Correct 2D slice
  - `df.iloc[1:4][2:]` ⚠️ Chained and potentially misleading

### 🧩 Practice & Execution:
- Implemented all examples in **Jupyter Notebook**
- Cross-verified behaviors using small DataFrame examples
- Completed reading **Pandas notes up to Boolean Masking**

### 📘 Resources Used:
- Yt Videos and Online Resources.
- 📄 PDF notes on Pandas  
- 🧠 Custom Notion-friendly notes (with code + output)  
- 🧪 Jupyter Notebook for testing slicing/indexing examples

---

## 🔄 Next Up:
- Start with **Boolean Indexing** in Pandas
- Apply Boolean masks and conditional filtering on DataFrames
- Begin integrating **Iris dataset** for real-world context

---

## 📝 Reflections:
- Clear understanding of `.loc` vs `.iloc` now
- 2D slicing with `.iloc[row_slice, col_slice]` feels intuitive
- Practiced chaining pitfalls — gained better control over slicing logic
