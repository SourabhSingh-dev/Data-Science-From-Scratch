# 🗓️ Day 03 – 05/07/2025

### 📍 Status: ✅ Completed

---

## ✅ What I did today:

* 📌 **Topics Covered:**
  - Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):  
    - Classes & Objects  
    - Constructors (`__init__`)  
    - Inheritance  
    - Method Overriding  
    - Encapsulation (Private Attributes)
  - Notes written in Notion for:
    - Magic Methods (`__str__`, `__repr__`)
    - Operator Overloading (`__add__`, `__sub__`, `__eq__`, `__mul__`)
    - Custom Exception Handling

* 📘 **Resources:**  
  - Krish Naik’s DS Udemy Course – Section 11  
  - Self-practice problems from official OOP assignments

---

## 💻 Problems Solved (Pushed to GitHub):
* `01 Basic Class and Object creation  
* `02 Constructor, Inheritance, Method Overriding  
* `03 Encapsulation using private attributes  
* `04 Object Composition (HAS-A relationship)
* Plus one to two basic questions.
---

## 🔄 Next Up:
* Continue OOP assignments:  
  - Abstract Classes  
  - Operator Overloading (more practice)  
  - Polymorphism & Multiple Inheritance
* Begin Advance Python from the course
* Push OOP `.py` files with proper folder structure

---

## 📝 Notes & Reflections:
* Understood the difference between **Overloading vs Overriding** clearly  
* Operator overloading was confusing at first, but makes sense now after writing real code  
* Created my first Composition structure — felt like modeling real-world logic  
* Notion-based note-taking system is finally working smoothly
