## ✅ What I did today:

### 📌 Topics Reviewed & Practiced:
- 📊 **Session 38 & 39: Descriptive Statistics (Parts 1 & 2)**
  - **Foundations:** Defined Statistics, identified its types (Descriptive vs. Inferential), and distinguished between Population and Sample.
  - **Data Analysis:** Explored different Types of Data (Nominal, Ordinal, Interval, Ratio).
  - **Central Tendency & Dispersion:** Mastered Mean, Median, Mode, Variance, Standard Deviation, and Coefficient of Variation.
  - **Data Visualization & Relationships:**
    - Practiced creating Frequency Distribution Tables and various graphs for **Univariate Analysis**.
    - Understood techniques for **Bivariate Analysis** (Categorical-Categorical, Numerical-Numerical, Categorical-Numerical).
    - Learned about **Quantiles, Percentiles, the Five Number Summary, and Boxplots**.
    - Deepened understanding of relationships using **Scatterplots, Covariance, and Correlation**, focusing on the critical distinction between Correlation and Causation.

- 📈 **Session 40: Probability Distribution Functions (PDF, CDF, PMF)**
  - **Random Variables:** Defined Random Variables (Discrete and Continuous).
  - **Distribution Functions:** Explored the types and roles of **PMF** (for Discrete variables) and **PDF** (for Continuous variables).
  - **Cumulative Functions:** Understood the **CDF** for both PMF and PDF, used to find the probability of a variable taking a value less than or equal to a specific point.
  - **Density Estimation:** Introduced **Density Estimation** techniques, including Parametric and Non-parametric methods like **Kernel Density Estimate (KDE)**.

---

## 🧩 Practice & Execution:
- Calculated and interpreted central tendency and dispersion metrics for sample datasets.
- Created and interpreted Boxplots to visually identify outliers and measure spread.
- Solved problems involving the calculation of probabilities using PMF and CDF formulas.
- Practiced interpreting KDE plots to understand data shape without assuming a distribution.

---

## 📘 Resources Used:
- 📝 Session materials for Descriptive Statistics and Probability Distributions.
- 💻 Python scripts for calculating statistical measures and generating plots (e.g., histograms, boxplots, scatterplots).

---

## 🔄 Next Up:
- **Common Probability Distributions:** Begin the deep dive into specific distributions (Binomial, Poisson, Normal, etc.).
- Apply the concepts of PMF/PDF/CDF to these specific distributions to understand their shapes and use cases in machine learning.

---

## 📝 Reflections:
- This session provided the essential mathematical toolkit for data analysis, which underpins all ML.
- The distinction between PMF (discrete) and PDF (continuous) is a key conceptual hurdle that has been clarified.
- Mastering descriptive stats and correlation is crucial for effective **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**.
