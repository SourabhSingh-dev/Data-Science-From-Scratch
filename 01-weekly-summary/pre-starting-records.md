# ⏮️ Pre-Starting Weekly Records

Before I properly start my weekly summaries (from Sept 2025 onward), here’s a quick recap of what I’ve already covered. This was a bit of a messy phase — I was on and off due to health issues and distractions — but it still gave me a solid base to build on.

---

## 🐍 Python Foundations (Days 00–07)
- Covered the **core Python basics**: functions, data structures, modules, file handling, and exceptions.  
- Went deep into **OOP**: classes, inheritance, overriding, encapsulation, abstract classes, operator overloading, and custom exceptions.  
- Touched on some **advanced Python** concepts like iterators, generators, and decorators (lightly).  
- Jumped into **NumPy** (arrays, slicing, masking, broadcasting, vectorization) and **Pandas** (DataFrames, indexing, masking, groupby, aggregation).  
- Closed this phase with some **data visualization** using Matplotlib and Seaborn.  

💭 **Reflection:**  
This phase was all about regaining Python fluency and getting comfortable with the tools used in Data Science. I was progressing well but then fell sick (typhoid), which forced me to pause. Still, I came out with a much better grasp of Python + libraries than when I started.

## 🗄️ SQL Foundations (Days 12–13)
- Started learning how to actually **create databases and tables** with DDL (`CREATE`, `DROP`, `TRUNCATE`).  
- Learned about constraints like `PRIMARY KEY`, `UNIQUE`, and `NOT NULL`.  
- Ran my first real queries with `SELECT`, `WHERE`, and `ORDER BY`.  
- Cleared up the difference between `TRUNCATE` vs `DELETE`.  

💭 **Reflection:**  
This was my first proper taste of databases. It felt powerful (and a bit risky) — one wrong command and you can drop a whole table. Also realized how important it is to design the schema carefully before pushing data in.

## 🤝 SQL Joins + Subqueries & Intro to ML (Days 14–20)
- Practiced **DML** commands: `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE`.  
- Worked with **Joins**: Inner, Left, Right, Full — applied them on Students & Courses tables.  
- Explored **subqueries**: both nested ones and correlated ones.  
- On the ML side, I finally stepped into the field:  
  - Understood what ML is and the difference between AI, ML, and DL.  
  - Learned about types of ML (Supervised, Unsupervised, Reinforcement).  
  - Built my first **Simple Linear Regression** model, understood slope/intercept, and plotted regression lines on sample datasets.  

💭 **Reflection:**  
This part was exciting because it felt like the bridge between handling data (SQL) and actually using it to build models (ML). The momentum was good, but I slipped into inconsistency again. Still, it gave me a strong starting point.

## 📝 Closing Thoughts
This “pre-starting” phase wasn’t perfect — I was inconsistent, had health setbacks, and got distracted. But looking back, I:  
- Built solid **Python + libraries** foundations,  
- Got started with **SQL schemas and queries**,  
- And touched **Machine Learning basics** with Linear Regression.  

From now (Sept 2025 onward), I’ll be consistent with daily logs and weekly summaries. This file is just a marker of everything I’ve done before starting fresh.
