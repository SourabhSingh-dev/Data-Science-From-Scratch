## ✅ What I did today:

* 📌 **Topics Reviewed & Practiced:**
  - 🧮 Matrix Multiplication using `np.dot()`
  - 📊 Aggregate Operations: `sum()`, `mean()`, `std()`, `max()` with axis
  - 🔁 Shape Manipulation: `reshape()`, `flatten()`, `transpose()`
  - 🔄 Broadcasting in NumPy:
    - Row-wise, column-wise, and scalar broadcasting
  - ⚡ Vectorization:
    - Distance calculation using vectorized operations
    - Loop vs vectorized comparison

* 🧩 **Practice & Execution:**
  - Solved **6 out of 10** questions from the **NumPy assignment**
  - Practiced matrix ops and broadcasting in Jupyter Notebook

* 📘 **Resources Used:**  
  - Self-created detailed notes  
  - Referred to NumPy PDF notes and past code snippets  
  - Hands-on coding in **VS Code** and **Jupyter**

---

## 🔄 Next Up:
* Finish the remaining **4 NumPy assignment questions**
* Start with **Pandas basics**: `Series`, `DataFrame`, and loading data

---

## 📝 Reflections:
* Broadcasting logic finally clicked — examples helped a lot  
* Vectorization is a game-changer for cleaner and faster code  
* Just 4 questions away from wrapping up the NumPy assignment! 💪
