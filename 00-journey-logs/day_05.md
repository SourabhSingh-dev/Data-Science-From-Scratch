### 📍 Status: ✅ Completed

## ✅ What I did today:

* 📌 **Topics Covered:**
  - 🧠 Data Science:
    - Numpy → Watched full video, implemented in VS Code
    - Pandas → Watched full video, used course file to practice and take clean notes
    - Notes written in Notion after practical execution

* 📘 **Resources:**
  - Krish Naik’s Data Science Udemy Course – Sections on Numpy & Pandas

---

## 💻 Tasks Completed:

* Executed Numpy and Pandas exercises from course files
* Created clean Notion notes (post-implementation, not just copy-paste)
* Ensured GitHub project repo health and synchronization

---

## 🔄 Next Up:

* Continue Next.js session — build layout, nested layout, and middleware concepts
* Move to next DS module: **Matplotlib + Data Visualization**
* Plan out small executable ML projects after Week 3

---

## 📝 Notes & Reflections:

* Felt retention dropped when copy-pasting code into notes — fixed it by running all code first, then summarizing in Notion
