# 🗓️ Day 06 – [11/07/2025]

### 📍 Status: ✅ Completed

---

## ✅ What I did today:

* 📌 **Topic Studied:**  
  - Data Manipulation with Pandas & NumPy (Hands-on)

* 📘 **Resources Used:**  
  - Krish Naik’s Data Science Udemy Course (Section 14)  
  - Sample CSV file (`data.csv`) for practice

* 💻 **Concepts Covered:**
  - DataFrame inspection with `.head()`, `.tail()`, `.info()`, `.describe()`
  - Handling missing values: `.isnull()`, `.fillna()`, column-wise fill
  - GroupBy operations: `.groupby()`, aggregation with `.mean()`, `.sum()`, `.count()`
  - Multi-column aggregation with `.agg()`
  - Merging datasets with different join types: `inner`, `outer`, `left`, `right`
  - Notes updated with new techniques and shortcuts
  - All code executed in VS Code and cross-verified

---

## 📁 GitHub Updates:

* ✅ Added:
  - `data_manipulation/missing_values_handling.py`
  - `data_manipulation/groupby_aggregation.py`
  - `data_manipulation/merging_dataframes.py`

---

## 🔄 Next Up:

* Reading data from various sources (Excel, SQL, JSON)
* Start **Data Visualization** module
* More hands-on practice with real datasets

---

## 📝 Notes & Reflections:

* GroupBy with `.agg({})` really helped in applying multiple summaries at once  
* Merging logic was tricky initially, but now clear with difference between joins  
* Created and revised clean, organized Pandas notes in Notion
