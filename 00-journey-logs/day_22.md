## ✅ What I did today:  

### 📌 Topics Reviewed & Practiced:  
- 📊 **Multiple Linear Regression (MLR)**  
  - Completed the **mathematical derivation** (Normal Equation, closed-form solution)  
  - Built **Multiple Linear Regression from scratch** (without scikit-learn)  
  - Learned the **limitations of OLS** (sensitivity to multicollinearity, outliers, assumptions of linearity & homoscedasticity)  
  - Explored **how to use ChatGPT effectively in Data Science**  
    - Debugging code faster  
    - Getting mathematical explanations  
    - Optimizing implementations  
    - Brainstorming project ideas  

---

## 🧩 Practice & Execution:  
- Implemented MLR using:  
  - Matrix operations (`X.T @ X`, inverse, and multiplication for β calculation)  
  - Manual gradient descent to cross-check results  
- Compared results of both approaches on a sample dataset  
- Asked ChatGPT for clarifications on tricky math steps & code efficiency  

---

## 📘 Resources Used:  
- 📄 My extended Linear Regression notes  
- 🔗 Online resources + ChatGPT for doubts  
- 🧪 Jupyter Notebook experiments  

---

## 🔄 Next Up:  
- Explore **Optimization** 

---

## 📝 Reflections:  
- Deriving Normal Equation gave a lot of confidence in matrix algebra  
- Realized why OLS alone is not always reliable in real-world datasets
