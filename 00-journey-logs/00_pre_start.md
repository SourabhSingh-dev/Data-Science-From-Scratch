## ⏮️ Sections Completed Before Official Logging (Pre–Day 01):

Before formally structuring this GitHub journey and logging progress, I had already completed the following sections from the course:

1. ✅ Getting Started
2. ✅ Python Programming Language
3. ✅ Python Control Flow
4. ✅ Inbuilt Data Structures in Python
5. ✅ Functions in Python

These sections serve as the foundation for everything that follows.
