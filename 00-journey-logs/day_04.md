# 🗓️ Day 04 – 07/07/2025

### 📍 Status: ✅ Completed

---

## ✅ What I did today:

* 📌 **Topics Covered:**
  - ✅ **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** – _Completed fully with assignments_:
    - Classes, Objects, Inheritance
    - Method Overriding & Composition
    - Encapsulation with private variables
    - Abstract Classes & Methods
    - Operator Overloading
    - Property Decorators (`@property`, `@setter`)
    - Custom Exception Handling
    - Polymorphism via `__str__`, `__repr__`, and method inheritance

  - 🚫 **Advanced Python (Skipped temporarily):**
    - Learnt iterators, generators, and decorators
    - Decided to revisit assignment after **Section 24: Feature Engineering**

* 📘 **Resources Used:**
  - Krish Naik’s DS Udemy Course – Section 11 & part of Section 12
  - Handpicked assignments from official OOP + Advanced Python tasks

## 🔄 Next Up:
* ✅ Begin **Section 13**: Data Analysis with Pandas
* 📝 Create `notes/da-notebook.md` in Notion
* 🔁 Revisit Advanced Python after completing Section 24 (Feature Engineering)

---

## 📝 Notes & Reflections:
* OOP feels **real and intuitive** after solving questions—not just theory now
* Abstract classes helped me design flexible, reusable code structures
* Learned how **@property** and **method chaining** make code clean
* Advanced Python (iterator protocol, decorators) is better understood **after core DS concepts** — will revisit confidently later
