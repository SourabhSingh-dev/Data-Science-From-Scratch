# 🗓️ Day 28 – 28/08/2025

### 📍 Status: ✅ Completed

---

## ✅ What I did today:

### 📌 Topics Reviewed & Practiced:
- 🗄️ **SQL – DDL (Data Definition Language)**
  - Learned `CREATE` command for creating databases & tables
  - Practiced `DROP` for removing tables/databases
  - Understood `TRUNCATE` vs `DELETE` (structure vs data)
  - Reviewed rules for defining constraints (`PRIMARY KEY`, `NOT NULL`, `UNIQUE`)

---

## 🧩 Practice & Execution:
- Created sample tables for practice (Students, Courses, etc.)
- Altered table schema by adding/modifying columns
- Dropped unnecessary practice tables
- Compared effects of `TRUNCATE` vs `DELETE`

---

## 📘 Resources Used:
- YT SQL tutorial series  
- 📄 SQL Notes (DDL reference)  
- 🧪 Online SQL sandbox  

---

## 🔄 Next Up:
- Start with **DML (Data Manipulation Language)**  
  - `INSERT`  
  - `UPDATE`  
  - `DELETE`  

---

## 📝 Reflections:
- DDL commands feel powerful but risky — one mistake can drop an entire table  
- Realized importance of carefully designing schema before inserting data  
- Liked experimenting with constraints to ensure data
