### 📍 Status: ✅ Completed  

---

## ✅ What I did today:  

### 📌 Topics Reviewed & Practiced:  
- 📊 **Descriptive Statistics – Part 2**  
  - Learned **Covariance** and **Correlation**  
    - Understanding relationship between two variables  
  - Explored **Interquartile Range (IQR)** and **Percentiles**  
  - Learned how to **plot a Box Plot** and interpret it  
  - Identified **outliers** using IQR method  
  - Divided data into **25%, 50%, and 75% tiles** (quartiles)  

---

## 🧩 Practice & Execution:  
- Calculated covariance and correlation on sample datasets  
- Computed percentiles and IQR manually and using Python  
- Plotted box plots to visualize spread and detect outliers  
- Divided data into quartiles and interpreted distributions  

---

## 📘 Resources Used:  
- 📄 Descriptive Statistics notes (Part 2)  
- 🔗 YouTube tutorials on Box Plots, Covariance & Correlation  
- 🧪 Jupyter Notebook experiments with sample datasets  

---

## 🔄 Next Up:  
- Explore **data visualization techniques** (histograms, bar plots, scatter plots)  
- Learn **how descriptive statistics informs feature engineering** in Data Science  

---

## 📝 Reflections:  
- Understanding quartiles and outliers makes dataset insights clearer  
- Box plots are extremely useful for quick visualization of spread and anomalies
