## 🗓️ Day 33 – 15/10/2025

### 📍 Status: ✅ Completed

## ✅ What I did today:

### 📌 Topics Reviewed & Practiced:
- 💡 **Session 43: Central Limit Theorem (CLT) & Discrete Distributions**
  - **Bernoulli Distribution:** Defined this fundamental discrete distribution for a single trial with two outcomes (success/failure) and a single parameter ($p$).
  - **Binomial Distribution:**
    - Understood its purpose: modeling the number of successes in a fixed number ($n$) of independent Bernoulli trials.
    - Reviewed the **PDF formula**, practiced interpreting the **Graph of PDF**, and worked through various real-world **Examples**.
    - Defined the **Criteria** for when a process follows a Binomial Distribution and explored its **Application in Data Science** (e.g., A/B testing, churn prediction).
  - **Central Limit Theorem (CLT):**
    - Defined the **Sampling Distribution** (the distribution of sample means).
    - Mastered the **Intuition of CLT**: Regardless of the population distribution's shape, the distribution of sample means will approach a Normal Distribution as the sample size ($n$) increases.
    - Reviewed the **Assumptions of making samples** (e.g., randomness, independence).
  - **CLT Proof & Application:** Dedicated time to review the mathematical **Proof of the CLT** and worked through a **Case Study** .

## 📘 Resources Used:
- 📄 Session materials dedicated to the mathematical proof of the Central Limit Theorem.
- 📊 Notes on Bernoulli and Binomial distribution criteria.

## 🔄 Next Up:
- **Data Transformation Implementation:** Finish the practical coding from Day 33, specifically implementing and comparing **Box-Cox** and **Yeo-Johnson** transformations.
- **Poisson and Exponential Distributions:** Cover the remaining key discrete and continuous non-Gaussian distributions.

## 📝 Reflections:
- The Central Limit Theorem is the single most important statistical concept for moving from descriptive analysis to making reliable inferences.
- The foundation in discrete distributions (Bernoulli/Binomial) is set for future classification work.
